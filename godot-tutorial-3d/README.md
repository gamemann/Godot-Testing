This is [Godot's](https://godotengine.org) [3D tutorial project](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html) made with Godot 4.2. There are a couple of customizations and checks added compared to the original. However, I was able to follow the tutorial smoothfully regardless of it not being confirmed it'll work on Godot 4.2.
