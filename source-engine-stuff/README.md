This is a [Godot](https://godotengine.org) project for testing physics and trying to make them similar to the Source Engine. This project uses a player controller that implements some of Source Engine's physics [here](https://github.com/BleyChimera/source_movement_godot_4). My goal is to continue working on this controller while learning more about Godot!
