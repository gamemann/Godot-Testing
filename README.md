This repository stores projects and tests for [Godot](https://godotengine.org). Godot is a popular **open source** game engine! While I've done game modding in the past, I haven't actually made games before.

I have a lot of ideas for tools I'd like to implement into Godot, but I first need to learn and understand Godot.

Follow my progression with learning Godot [here](https://moddingcommunity.com/topic/186-my-progression-with-learning-godot/)!
